Draw sound using a Wacom tablet and Max/MSP

These patches require the Wacom Max External:
Version-3.1ÃŸ5 UB for Mac os X, Written by Jean-Michel Couturier, 2006, www.jmcouturier.com.

This project is almost 10 years old, undocumented, and requires a Wacom tablet. I don't own one, so I can't currently test the project or privide technical support. I am sharing it here under CC-BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) for anyone who wants to try the patch or adapt it for a project of their own.
